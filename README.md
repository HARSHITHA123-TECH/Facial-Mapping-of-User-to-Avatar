# Facial-Mapping-of-User-to-Avatar
## Introduction
Realistic face animation is a key element in 3D virtual environments that show the presence of characters, both human and non-human. Some of their uses include the 3D gaming industry, interactive software, and 3D animated movies. Facial Mapping of User to Avatar is rooted in the idea of capturing the intricacies of human facial expressions, mapping them onto digital characters or avatars, and enabling users to navigate the digital world while maintaining a sense of personal identity. 
## Motivation
* When people are preoccupied with various tasks being presentably ready for meetings and classes seems a little problematic.
* Online classes taken by teachers can seem monotonous and boring to students.
* Gaming in VR with our own avatar seems so much cooler than using existing animated characters in video games
